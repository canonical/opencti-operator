# OpenCTI operator
<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) for deploying and managing the [OpenCTI](https://filigran.io/solutions/open-cti/)
open source threat intelligence platform in your systems. 

This charm simplifies the configuration and maintenance of OpenCTI system and 
commonly used OpenCTI connectors across a range of environments, enabling users
to collect, correlate, and leverage threat data at strategic, operational and 
tactical levels.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more. 

The OpenCTI charm allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes platforms, from 
[Canonical Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

This charm will make operating OpenCTI simple and straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through Juju's clean interface.
