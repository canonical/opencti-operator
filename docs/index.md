# OpenCTI Operator

<!-- A single sentence that says what the product is, succinctly and memorably. Add a 1-2 sentence description of what the charm software does. -->

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) for deploying and managing the [OpenCTI](https://filigran.io/solutions/open-cti/)
open source threat intelligence platform in your systems. 

<!-- A paragraph of 2-5 short sentences, that describes what the product does and what need the product meets. -->

This charm simplifies the configuration and maintenance of OpenCTI system and 
commonly used OpenCTI connectors across a range of environments, enabling users
to collect, correlate, and leverage threat data at strategic, operational and 
tactical levels.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more. 
For the OpenCTI charm, this includes:
* list or summary of app-specific features 

The OpenCTI charm allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) to 
[Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

<!-- Finally, a paragraph that describes whom the product is useful for. -->

This charm will make operating OpenCTI simple and straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through Juju's clean interface.
